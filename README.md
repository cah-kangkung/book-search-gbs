# Book Search App with Google Books API
This app is a submission for Dicoding "Basic Web Programming" course. Made entirely with pure HTML, CSS, Javascript, and of course Google Books API. Taking advantage of ES6 `fetch()` function, fetching data from an API is as easy as pie. And aslo, string literal, ooouu how much i love 'em.
